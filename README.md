 This project involves developing a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews 
 as positive or negative using the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset. We preprocess the text data by
 cleaning and tokenizing the reviews, then use a machine learning pipeline that combines a
 CountVectorizer with a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The model is trained on a subset
 of the dataset and evaluated for accuracy on a test set. Finally, the model is capable of
 predicting sentiments for new reviews, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing and
 understanding public sentiment towards movies.
